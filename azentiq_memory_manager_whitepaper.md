# Azentiq Memory Manager: White Paper for Open Source Community

## Executive Summary

As Agentic AI continues to gain traction, intelligent systems increasingly depend on their ability to recall, reason, and adapt across long, multi-step workflows. However, most current frameworks offer limited or no structured memory support. The Azentiq Memory Manager addresses this critical gap by introducing a pluggable, extensible, and high-performance memory layer designed to serve as a universal foundation for memory in agentic systems.

This white paper introduces the motivation behind the project, the architectural design, key features available in the MVP, and a roadmap for future growth. We invite developers, researchers, and contributors to join us in shaping the future of memory infrastructure for agentic AI.
